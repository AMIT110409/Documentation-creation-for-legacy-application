# registration_another_channel.feature

**Path**: `features\api\shop\registration_another_channel.feature`

## Summary
This Gherkin feature file defines a test scenario for API shop registration, specifically verifying that a user cannot register with an email address already in use on another channel. The test exists to ensure data consistency and prevent duplicate accounts across different sales channels, such as "fr" and "de", in an e-commerce platform. By testing this scenario, the code validates the registration process and prevents potential errors or security vulnerabilities related to user account management.
