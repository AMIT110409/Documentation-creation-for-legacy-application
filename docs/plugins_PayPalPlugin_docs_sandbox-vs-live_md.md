**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\docs\sandbox-vs-live.md`

## Summary
This documentation file explains the difference between sandbox and live modes in the PayPal plugin, with the plugin defaulting to sandbox mode for testing purposes. The file provides configuration instructions to switch to live mode by setting the `sandbox` parameter to `false` in a YAML configuration file. This exists to facilitate testing and deployment of the plugin in various environments, such as production, by allowing developers to toggle between sandbox and live PayPal transactions.
